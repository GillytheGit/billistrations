blog-header: I pure didn't get one identity
---

Identity gives people a sense of value, some context, some pattern to refer to. It is almost a guide on how to be. Not on how to act, simply on how to be, to exist. People from countries with rich and evident cultural references, old buildings, rituals etc. seem to have more grounding, more poetry, more nuance to the way they live. Lack of history in a place seems to increase the chances of a disconnect with it's inhabitants. A baker is a baker, not just another employee in a multiplex. Life would be a little richer if the former were the case. I am not very informed on this subject, I just like the noise the keyboard makes when I type. Typey typey type type.
