I have started a podcast with a base of hubris and tenacity, which should then be iced with an open mind and organised retention. I almost forgot about the learning part. It is slow for me. The only way things sink in is repeated mistakes coupled with an angry internal monolouge. The frustration of being stupid is a great incentive to learn.

My previous guest [Tom Farrah, an award winning product designer](http://farrah.com.au/pages/about) was great craic but I screwed up the audio and need 10 more years of interviewing practice, just like Irish Rail “Where not there yet.” 

[Here is another link his website](http://farrah.com.au) (for the spiders) and below are some pictures of us having conversations about the creative process and designing things and making pictures.
