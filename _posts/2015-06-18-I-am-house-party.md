I wake up. I wake up fully before my eyes open. “It’s fucking dar…”  I open my eyes. Everything around me seems familiar, I can’t be sure. I open and close my mouth a few times making the sound of masking tape being peeled off a wall in segments. I realise that I have woken up drunk.
“euuugh” I think….”What did I….”
 
Everything comes flooding back inta my mush, in one mighty mush, “Holy crap I’m remembering everything at once”. I think. It seems like the perfect night. All the ingredients were present  (A) nobody had “the night club mission agenda”, (B) the house wasn’t owned by it’s occupants & (C) I think I need beer. Richer detail comes flooding back. Surely I’m only remembering the good bits, real life can’t be this well edited? The perfect sound track? I can’t believe I‘m part of this production. Every anecdote and laugh,  every visual and auditory texture is carved inta my brain by a drunk dancing Zoro wearing dungarees whilst mis-quoting denzel washington. Fuck I feel awfully amazing… and also the other way around as well….
 
The microcosm of the perfect house party allows people to exist in a perfect glee filled utopian bubble, a sexy petri dish of human experience. The common agenda is simple, maximum enjoyment is achieved through the largest quantity of sincere connections . The levels of depth at which this can reach, has complex and varied methods of genesis. One of the more nuanced moments of any good house party is the emergence of unique and resourcefully created games,  “ShoeStick”(™) is one of my favourites. (You had to have been there). Once the perfect house party hits optimum velocity, 90% of the attending individuals are in full flow, using their powers of rhythmical air mouth expulsion and wobbly skin bag maneuvering to assist in their collective and numerously varied channels of communicable reciprocity, as a dirty, smelly, chemical fueled, warbling representation of everything. The house starts to feel, it starts to think, no, it knows…  “I am houseparty.”
 
Oh yes. I was waking up.There is now the hangover to enjoy. The skeleton crew of party goers get to drink tea and eat stale toast in their dirty clothes, the post mortem helps solidify the house as being alive in that moment. We inadvertently give it life and silently agree to recognise it for its inherent and unquestionable wisdom. “Ha hahhaha” we say to each other.
 
Inevitably the time comes when I have to leave. I have to leave that perfect moment (That perfect 9 to 24 hour moment) behind and fall back into the torrid river of insecurity and identity crisis. When ever my insecurities become apparent to those around me, the advice usually offered is “Just be yourself, you’ll be fine”. Seems like a perfectly normal amount of words to say. "mmmm, am i houseparty?” I have to ask myself. I wish I felt houseparty now.
 
Prior to this shared community catharsis, most of the attendees will spend too much time worrying about what it is that their actual function is, as a boney coat hanger for flesh, being propelled through nothing at inconceivable speeds. “ueergh… what if?...... nah….maybe….the…” Is what people think.
 
Being myself seems to consist of, insecurity, arrogance, perversion, assumption, impetuousness and greed, in varying degrees….. I prefered when I was houseparty. Being houseparty means being everybody else. Sharing and connecting with the dance of expulsion and revulsion, and  “ShoeStick”(™) ya gotta play “ShoeStick”(™)

Every interaction should be houseparty, and one should leave every interaction with a new character appendage, emergently increasing the voltron that is you, which means everybody will be everybody else, which makes everyone. Thats
