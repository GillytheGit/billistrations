Hello there. A few thoughts to extrapolate on. The internet is great, but like the consumption of bananas, it needs to be moderated. I really enjoy reading books. I like that there is nothing to distract me from the thing that it is I am engaging in. I like that I don’t have to turn a book on or charge it. I like the fact that the thoughts, ideas & concepts in a book have had to fight much harder to get produced, to exist. I like to think of books as the physical representation of ideas. You can literally carry around ideas, or keep ideas in your house. Why not absorb an idea whilst extracting waste from your butt hole.

Technically the content online takes up physical space somewhere, or is it just electricity? I should use wikipedia to check this... no shit sorry.... I should use a book... hang on I’ll just check what books are good online.... argh... so I mean whatever the physical manifestation of content and ideas online is, it isn’t as good as a book. I have broken the lock and let the irony of this post escape. I shall continue to type.

This smells like fear of change. The internet is the most amazing thing ever made. How long are you alive? If you take it for granted, use that foundation to create more exciting things. If you grew up through the creation and spread of the internet then you must now imagine, you imagining now, back when it didn’t exist. Sci-fi writers from the 80’s may have thought a pocket television, phone, banking & anodyne thought sharing device a bit far fetched for their contemporaries to digest.

I like reading and holding books and I also like watching fat people laugh at goats that scream like humans so I suppose I’ll keep doing both. What’s your name?
