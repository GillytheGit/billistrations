I enjoy mking art for people. I think I do them for a few reasons. Maybe it's because I want to be liked, and this seems to make people like me. I find it hard to articulate to people what I feel about my feeeeelings so I draw a picture about something that they like so that by association they like me. A simpler way of putting it would be "Not dislike by proxy".

Please view some examples of these illustrations below. Pleeeasssee. If you enjoyed these go to my facebook and become my friend so that I have to make you a card.
