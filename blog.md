Welcome to my blog. Here is a picture of me blogging. All my posts are listed to the right. This place isn't for you, it's for me so please go instagram youself. Take that as you will. Take a good photo of yourself. A real good photo. I don't have instagram. Maybe I should? What do you think?

This is what my wife thinks I look like most of the time. Despite this photographic eveidence I do have a face and I am a man. I believe that it is time. Please click on all the links on this for the looking at the other things.

If you look very very closely, you will see a picture of a penis that was added to this piece by a friend. That friend is also a penis. A penis I say.
