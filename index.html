desc: Hi I'm Billy O'Reilly, I am trying to finish as many good illustrations as I can before I die, sorry woah, I'm not terminally ill or anything I just know that someday I will die, and so will you. So why not look at some of my images before you die? I make a podcast every week with a special guest so that they can talk about how other artists have affected their lives. The guests range from musicians, artists to builders and lay abouts, tyring to build an all round perspective.
