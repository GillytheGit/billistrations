Gabriel Bergomoser was my wonderful guest this episode. Gabriel is a Melbourne based author and playwright whom recently won the prestigious Sir Peter Ustinov Television Scriptwriting Award for his pilot screenplay based on Windmills and was flown to the International Emmys in New York in November to accept.

His new book Boone Shepard is available to buy, so you know, you should go buy it and read it and become enriched. 

Check out his book [here.]({{ site.url }}/work/owlleaf.html)

The illustration is a newer version of an older version of a version I haven't showed you. This is something to do with photosynthesis and being an owl. Great.
