Another non-functioning and upsetting representation of the speed and haste of the persistently pervasive postmodern portmanteau predicament. These are a lot of the things I love congealed into a stressful illustration, even though I enjoyed creating this piece, it looks slightly broken and upsetting or you know…., it could just be very late and I’m tired and it’s just a cool blue unicorn-asaurus robot thing with beams coming out of its eyes.
