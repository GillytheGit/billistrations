What? Did I miss it? Oh great it’s easter humans. The always returning Zombie Jesus, lives in the moment, the always moment. So it doesn’t matter when this is received, time is an eggularcler flat hierachy. Every year the same moment, every year the same Zombie. It was earth all along.

Revolving and moving through the orb of everything, the now Zombie Jesi fordge bravely forth, after watching the George A Ramano masterpiece and missing the point. The bluntness was un. a. voidable. Let’s all go to the lobby.
 
Whilst and after during, the forever loveing ”Cock a doodle don’t right right now” resides lovingly in a self similar pinacle, metaphorically meaning derision and decisiveness. Oh green eyed Sam I am, why did you receive more spam I am?

Cantor set, match and game on my friends. Always live for tomorrow right now. Always twirling. ALWAYS...
