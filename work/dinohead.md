Meet Naparanetacus, 'Nap' for short. Nap is the embodiment and history of the internet. When angry Nap will use his reference from that time that he watched jurassic park and lean forward and roar out of his back engine. Naps face, or interface, is made up of everything that can be represented as pixels but just chooses not to be. Naps face remains in this expression constantly, sometimes flickering. His wand, or 'Stick that he holds', is sentient but entirely useless. It does scare off those who may presume to think that Nap has some sort of magical powers of that he does not. HE DOES NOT! The stick face will be dragged through whatever is on the ground at the time of dragging when nap is walking around the place. It's like one of those animals that have fake eyes to scare away predatorsâ€¦ I hope we all understand each other.
