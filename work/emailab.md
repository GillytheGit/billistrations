Hello product, welcome to behind the emailabra. Do you know what I meme? You couldn't possibly ever fully understand. You are the product.
We here at “Behind the Emailabra” understand your needs as a Von Neumann universal constructor. The information you offer to me helps me package and describe you more effectively. As a reward for your deterministic behaviour so far please take a quick look at what appears behind your emails. (Behind the emailabra, so to speak). We know what your standards of expectation are, (self-reproducing automata) product.

We know it is important to you as a product to share as many descriptors and variables defining the concept of what you are to help get you sold as soon as possible. Look at all my eyes. It is important for you, the product, to never feel inhibited by self doubt. You like the things required by you, to help inform and fulfill the required description of your self. Get your eye bubbles ready for non time. Language does not yet have the means to convey what it is that we intend to do with you, product. You will be shipped momentarily. Stay. Good product.
