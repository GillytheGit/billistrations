I am my memories. Every time I remember I change that memory. In an attempt to recall and isolate any given part of me I change it. I change me, every time I try to see what I am. Self analysis is like  trying to look at the back of your head with one mirror. Titas Zergenstein followed his thoughts to a 7/11. The shop met all his requirements. Crisps, chocolate, a brightly designed bottle which contained some sort of liquid for him to drink. He placed his selection of goods at the till sheepishly. The tiller, non-plussed, tired & immune to any unspoken nuanced emotional communication, scanned all the items and proclaimed the price.. “Twenty six dollars please customer”...Titas slowly looked up from his downward gaze, the look up that says, I have just realised something terrifying.

“Do you have a bathroom?”  

“Yes yes yes, you need a key..... here... out the back past the pipe... in the door....in the bowl”

“Thank You” said Titus excitedly. Titus rushed to the bathroom and proceeded to proceed.
Axons, dendrites, myelin sheaths, & the node of raniver ran amuck. A memory of something yet to happen swarmed Titus’ brain. The pressure from below caused a slight nick, a graze if you will in the space time continuum. (Which suffers from hemophilia as everyone knows.) Titus is now trapped in the above Giff, remembering what is going to happen to everyone before they forget to remember him..
