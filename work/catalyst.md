Catalysis is the increase in the rate of a chemical reaction due to the participation of an additional substance called a catalyst. With a catalyst, reactions occur faster and with less energy. Because catalysts are not consumed, they are recycled. Often only tiny amounts are required.

<!-- In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as a typically audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through such as air or water. In physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain.

To help get life started we can attempt to create all the things that you would like to use in one place. Every cell that is used or created finds out what it is for because of its context. I am at the top, then I must be the head. Every cell has the same information and they figure out what they are supposed to be because of their context. This is true and you should pay attention to it for all of time. -->
