“Double Tip Crippsy” the cat was in her bed, the bed made by her slender somewhat sentient slavery meat bags. Their comfort creating abilities were somewhat effective she thought. Crippsy deserved this life of comfort and began to settle into her fluffy cat bed.

Near drifting off, a thought kept entering her cat head, not her human head, she kept that buried in the garden out of the sentimental gaze of the slender somewhat sentient meat bag slaves that had somehow made residence in the same abode. The thought was like a vibration, a pulsing tension trying to articulate something more than “Meowww”... is it “Puuurrrr?” she thought, but with cat thoughts, which are better..

This fuzzy throb kept getting louder in her mind, drowning out all the other thoughts like, “Why do I have lizard eyes if I'm a mammal?”  and “When are these meat bags going to explain to me what mirrors are?”. Just to try anything to settle her mind she walked out to the  nearby forest, looking for some clarity and maybe a mouse.

As she walked the thought progressively faded. She ambled past 2 crickets complaining about the continuation of the weather and frogs effusing their love for dried hummus cubes. This was odd, firstly that she was now able to, all of sudden, understand what crickets and frogs were saying, but also what they were saying seemed like an unnecessary non-sequitur. The fog lifted from her mind and the thought finally became clear. “What was meowing on? I need to figure out what is going on right meow.” So just to clear, the confusing thought she couldn’t understand was that she couldn't understand what anything was.

Crippsy decided to walk back to the 2 crickets to find out why they were shouting about the predictably unpredictable predicament of the weather. “What for?” said the fat cricket, startled, quickly turning towards the bright cat lizard eyes in the dark. “I’ll tell ya another thing about clouds….” said the skinny cricket whom was of yet to notice the lizard eyed cat, whom remained curiously looming. “Fudge!” the skinny cricket finally exclaimed.

“Sorry to bother you fellas, I just wondering if you could help me” said crippsy, “Sure” said fatty, “We’ve been waiting for you good lady”... “Wha?..” said skinny.. “shut up…” hissed fatty dragging skinny close. “These beat nick confused buska cats only happen once a green frog, we gotta jive this pawed pussy plod, ya fresh?”  “Wha?...” said skinny again in a very similar tone to his initial request for clarity.

“Just come with us my dear…” said fatty as he dragged skinny along by his side.

Crisspy was usually curious, but she was also impatient so she decided to not follow skinny and fatty and just ate them hastily as she thought it might clear her head from this nonsense.

“Ah fuck”... siad fatty, crunch.. “argh”....scchrunch…:leak….”waaah”...snap...gulp.

After swallowing her confusing somewhat short companied companions, Crippsy decided to sit and maybe just take…. a little….. I’ll be fine….. just a few minutes… of sleep….

A deep rich blackness overtook Crippsies soul, the kind of sleep that you don’t wake up from. Unless of course, you wake up, which she did.

Her eyes fluttered open and everything was familiar immediately. Which she thought was strange, you don’t wake up after a trippy adventure and feel that everything is as it should be. “I love my weird spindly ukulele playing fingers” she thought, and then immediately thought “Wow I'm thinking in human thoughts” followed by the triptych of thoughts for this collection of musings “You must triple think your wobbly head to remember to forget all of this” “Agreed” she thought to herself. ”I have this ukulele for ever.

“Have I always been a floaty cat pug drifting in a never ending cube space of non-sense cells”. I am pretty sure that I think that I should probably feel great". A distant echo of a thought started poking her brain head. “What, what is it that I need to do?” She thought with human thoughts.

A voice from beyond the screen chanted 

“Crippsy, Cripppssyyy you must puke up what remains of those crickets, both skinny and fat and  sing them to life with your human voice and ukulele playing spindly man hands This will ensure that they become horrible cricket zombies who wished death was final. You must then eat them again to return to your real life…. scary noiiiseessss” Crippsy not being much the questioning type, curiously so, did exactly as the voice required.

Crippsy now plays the ukulele on a street corner in a universe where every cat is now an awkward human. All of which suffer from more existential angst then a blender drink made of emos? What ever the name for intelligent yet insecure teenagers is these days.
