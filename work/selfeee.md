I was 8. I wanted to be a dinosaur. I also wanted to be a paleontologist. I needed to create a reality in which I could be both. So I did because I was a child. (AKA Magician)

My friends and I used different textures of sand to create fossil dig sculptures.The process began with digging a shallow, 2-3 metre wide hole in the sand. The next step consisted of sculpting a Velociraptor skeleton with wet sand, followed by covering the entire sculpture with dry sand. This allowed us to then brush off the dry sand, given greater immersion in our playing paleontologist experience. The air would then be filled with exuberant thespian esque effusions, similar to “How lucky, to have found such a complete specimen”. Lastly and most importantly we would run around mimicking theropodic (bipedal meat-eaters) dinosaurs (correct position of the hands was essential) expeditiously vocalising the frolicsome roars of a hunting Deinonychus/Albertosaurus/etc.

I think the work that paleontologists do is very important but must also anesthetize the frontal cortext. It may be worth while allowing paleontologists to act like the dinosaurs that they are discovering. For every new bone uncovered they could run around like an Albertosaurus for while, roaring at their superior paleontology officer. “RRRUUUEEEEGEGHEHGH” they would say.

To summarize, society needs to change in the following ways. Paleontology training needs to now include acting and improv classes as well as costume design and cooking. (Cooking isn’t directly related to paleontology but will help this rare breed of human mate, therefore increasing the chances of thoughtful and academically driven humans to populate a larger percentage of the earth). I may have just advocated eugenics, whoops, sorry, that's bad. I don't want to re-write this page now so just take my word for it that I'm great.
