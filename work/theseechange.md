30,000 years from now...  no wait... now, a version of "us" exists in a world where our brains are simple enough for us to understand how they work, making it impossible for us to understand how they work. 

Creative speculation leads to intrigue as an emergent collective of beings, whom for this paragraphs sake, we shall call “The See” make headway towards an unknown accomplishment. They are a collective of protosentient asexual vestigalful beings living in a land of deep purple rain.

They hail the lord and god almightly “Eggblang”. Eggblang is the moon. The See must evolve to a greater sentience so that they can build a suffeciently advanced enough technology to launch themselves to the “Eggblang” and join with it, very much like the Skeksis from the dark crstal. Once this is achieved, then, and only then will they be able to eat terrible food, ask strangers what their feelings mean and miss lots of important appointments.
