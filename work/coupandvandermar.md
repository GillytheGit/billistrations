Art for your art holes. You have many art holes. You can experience expression through many orifices. Lovely food in the mouth. Lovely music in the side heads. Lovely light waves in your top light soaking squishy orbs. I, this guy (whom has both thumbs), prefer to art-iculate with the latter. The latter is the last of the list above. The former is before the latter and the former of the latter of which I am referring.

Look at the image. I encourage you to imagine the pig man running whilst at the same time trying to shoot a person of good reputation. Hilarious results? Results may vary.

This piece of art for your art hole is inspired from the common trope in popular culture of a duo, a pair whom seem to form one character. They are one character yet represent a very visual dichotomy. Dumb and dumber, evil and eviler. Pinky and the Brain. Coup and Vandermere.

Why not listen to a thing I gone and done with a lovely person? Why would you? Should you? Poems with questions?
