An old man walks into his workshop, he looked up and thought the wandering sentient hive mind lamps were very agitated today. Apparently the zeitgeist detector had detected another anomaly, this was the third in a week.

Sam put all of this at the back of his mind, he needed to create something new. Something that would help people, that would bring joy to people. Something that would distract them from the horrors of today's reality. We all knew there was very little time left. Sam felt very strongly that it was his responsibility to create something which resonated and brought joy to those close to him.

Sam needed a good memory to help him create so he opened his nostalgia machine and set it to “Quarkdon”. This would throw up an initial thought, firstly a seemingly meaningless moment, which would upon a concentrated focus become something of infinite inspiration and wonder. It always worked, taking the meaningless and crystallizing it into meaning. It really was a wondrous machine, something of an introspective abstract emotional cinema, the infinite dimension, if you will. You will.

After several days of blissful immersion in his workshop Sam gently and suddenly awoke to a start of inspiration. The pangs of hunger and soiled garments were nothing to distract him from this moment off captured creation, he began to work.

The result was a resurrected memory, a frankensteined joy machine for children, an indecipherable echo from a time similar to that of star wars. It’s function, nothing, it’s reason, the same.

Sam left his shed to go back into his house and turn on his Playbox 5000 JD double ram. He enjoyed that.
