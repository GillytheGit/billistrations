GameLad is the representation of the re-appropriation of memories and cultural iconography. I am trying to express the way which cultural artifacts or memories which have a deep connection for me growing up are now being reused by culture as symbols of status. I’m not saying it’s good or bad, it’s just happening and this is a picture showing that. You could also call it a frankenmemory.
