Tony Maggot wisely gets all his moral guidance from a medieval fairy tale. Fighting off any and all opportunities for a constructive dialectic, telling reason to go do something rude to itself & being an all round generally dislikable person, left, right and (that's right, you guessed it) centre. Let us eat oval shaped confectionery so that it may appease the mighty Zombie Jebus, or something of some such. I haven't really looked into it... Than how can you criticize it you say? Nazareth Times Headline boldly states "IMAGINARY OMNIPOTENT CLOUD MAN MAKES TEENAGER PREGNANT, HUSBAND SAYS â€œNO WORRIES"

To help us understand the reasoning & teachings behind this ancient & wise zombie, the tale has evolved into a more contemporary, sensical & articulate allegory. A giant bunny lays chocolate eggs for you to eat, but he hides them in the garden, because if you want chocolate easter bunny embryos you need to hunt for them, like lions.... which obviously means the mighty Zombie Jebus wants us allll to hunt chocolate rabbit embryos, just like lions did at some stage in some other story somewhere in some language.

Here is a another short story which can be linked by you, if you should so choose, to the above meandering thought farts.......ah..ah...ahem........A man wants to be the most important man. He believes in zombies and he doesn't believe in human rights. So I drew a picture of him as a maggot. Tony Maggot. Good story (I now say "Good story" to myself after any noise that comes out of any, of my many, orifices). The very end.
