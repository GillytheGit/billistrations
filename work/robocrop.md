Fractals can be described as a self repeating pattern to infinity. A Von Neumann machine can be described by Wikipedia. Wikipedia says it's a "Self-replicating machine, a class of machines that can replicate themselves. Universal constructor (disambiguation)". I don't know why these are connected, but like everything else, they are.

The machine in this image is the star of a 5 minute short before the movie Cars 3 (not true). It is the symbiotic symbol of the last of it's kind. The robocrop needs the tree to live and survive and the tree needs the robot to protect it against the wood peckers of the frog botted cross pollinated land of purple squares. Let it be known.

The Melbourne stand up comic Peter Jones was the guest of this weeks podcast, it is good. Sure have a listen to it.
