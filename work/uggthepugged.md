A man walks into town looking for his identity. He doesn’t know he is looking for an identity, yet he is compelled, pushed forward to sate this overwhelming desire he does not understand. “If I could somehow look really cute, yet somehow very ugly at the same time”  I think this would be perfect mix for me to be accepted by all my peers.This mans name was Ugg and he just got himself pugged.
